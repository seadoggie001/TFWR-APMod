# The Farmer Was Replaced - Archipelago Mod

## Prerequisites

For this mod to work, you will need to install BepInEx for The Farmer Was Replaced.
You can find setup directions on the BepInEx site: 
https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

The "game folder" is located:
- Windows: `%AppData%\Steam\steamapps\common\The Farmer Was Replaced\`
- Linux: `/home/<username>/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/The Farmer Was Replaced/`

## Installation of the Mod

To install the mod, extract the zip and copy the files to the game folder followed by: `BepInEx/plugins/TFWRArchipelago`

When updating the mod, it's good practice to delete the old files first instead of copying and replacing.

## Randomization

This is still being worked on... for now, there's not much.
